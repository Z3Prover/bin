Z3 was successfully built.
Z3Py scripts can already be executed in the 'build/master/debug/python' directory.
Z3Py scripts stored in arbitrary directories can be executed if the 'build/master/debug/python' directory is added to the PYTHONPATH environment variable and the 'build/master/debug' directory is added to the DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.
Use the following command to install Z3 at prefix /usr/local.
    sudo make install

Z3 was successfully built.
Z3Py scripts can already be executed in the 'build/master/release/python' directory.
Z3Py scripts stored in arbitrary directories can be executed if the 'build/master/release/python' directory is added to the PYTHONPATH environment variable and the 'build/master/release' directory is added to the DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.
Use the following command to install Z3 at prefix /usr/local.
    sudo make install
